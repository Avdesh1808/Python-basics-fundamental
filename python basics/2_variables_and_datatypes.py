# variables = is a container where data is assigned.
# Creating variables in Python
Name = "Avdesh" # 'name' stores a string 
age = 22 #  'age' stores an integer
height =  1.69 # 'height' stores a floating-point  number 
is_student =  True  # 'is_student' stores a boolean 
# string , ineger , floating-point number , boolean these are datatypes in python.

# Print these data types in terminal:
print(Name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_student)


''' Based on the official Python documentation, the core, built-in data types are generally counted as being in these 12 distinct categories:

1.  **Numeric Types:**
    * `int`
    * `float`
    * `complex`

2.  **Sequence Types:**
    * `list`
    * `tuple`
    * `range`
    * `str`

3.  **Mapping Type:**
    * `dict`

4.  **Set Types:**
    * `set`
    * `frozenset`

5.  **Boolean Type:**
    * `bool`

6.  **None Type:**
    * `NoneType` (with its single value `None`)

Additionally, there are a few other specialized types, which can be grouped as:

7.  **Binary Types:**
    * `bytes`
    * `bytearray`
    * `memoryview`

8.  **Callable Types:**
    * `function` (user-defined functions)
    * `method` (methods of a class)
    * `type` (used to represent classes)

9.  **Module Type:**
    * `module`

10. **Class & Instance Types:**
    * `class`
    * `object` (instance of a class)

11. **Iterator Types:**
    * `iterator` (from `iter()` calls)
    * `generator` (from generator functions)

12. **File Object Type:**
    * `file` (file objects from `open()`)

While a direct, single number for "total data types" can be ambiguous due to 
the nature of object-oriented programming (where every class creates a new type), 
listing the core built-in types gives a comprehensive overview of the fundamental
building blocks of Python. The first six categories (`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`
,tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `bool`, and `NoneType`) are the ones you will use most frequently
in everyday programming.'''
